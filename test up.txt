Dear a Hieu

I am writing this email to inform you of my resignation from my position, until the end of June 30

My experience with Global Cybersoft has been valuable. I have got the chance to work with a great team and a great manager. 
All of you have helped me so much for almost a year.

I would like to thank the company so much for every opportunity and experiences I have been offered me. I wish Hitachi Vantara continued success in the future.

Sincerely yours,
